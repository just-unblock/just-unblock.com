The concept of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is somewhat abstract, you can imagine it like a tunnel that connects you to with your desired destination. On the other hand the non-VPN unblocker is even more complex, but the good thing is that either of them are actually quite easy to use and accomplish their job quite well. The difficult step now, is to select a service.

To make it simple, we made a selection of best unblocking services we had to select one of each, the best VPN service, and the best non-VPN service for unblocking your favorite content and services overseas.

Each one has it's advantages, let's get into detail:

As the name implies [ProxyDNS][proxydns] focuses on a DNS service (and recently added a Browser Extension for Google Chrome), this means that instead they let you enable any device by only changing the DNS settings of thet device, making it possible to unblock the devices otherwise would be impossible like the Roku, FireTV, XBOX, etc. even better you can unblock all the devices in your house by just changing the DNS settings on your Wifi Router.

Since they are not a VPN your browsing speeds will not be affected, and your private Gmail, Facebook, Banks, etc traffic will remain the same. Only the sites that require geo-unblocking will go by the Proxy. Cool right?

They recently renovated their platform and seems to be better than ever. We invite you to also give them a shot, [they allow you to test the service for just one dollar](https://www.proxydns.co/#pricing).
