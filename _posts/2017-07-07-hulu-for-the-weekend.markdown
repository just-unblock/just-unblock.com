One of the best thing of being **geo-unblocked** is access to a lot more movies than your local [Netflix](https://netflix.com) content, and one of our favorite is **[hulu](https://hulu.com/)**, so here you have a couple of recommended movies to watch this weekend:

## [Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (2016) [HULU]](https://www.hulu.com/watch/1010470):

After careful consideration, Kim Baker, a news copywriter, decides to leave the relative comfort of a New York desk job and serious boyfriend Chris to accept the assignment to work for three months as on-camera reporter in war torn Afghanistan, as her news agency is looking for anyone within their ranks to fill immediately the empty voids overseas.
